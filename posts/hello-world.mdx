A **["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)** program is generally a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". 


```js
console.log(`Hello world`);
```

<MotionButton/>

If you see that `hello world` flying around, it means that my site is working properly. 💫💫💫
